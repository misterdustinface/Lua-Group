# Lua-Group

A group is a collection of objects which allows use of the public interface of the objects as a collection.

A method call on a group is equivalent to a method call of each object in the group that has the called method, giving the group a "loose interface" as a functional collection.

Calls on a group have variable method dispatch settings.
